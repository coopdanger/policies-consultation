DRAFT RECORDS RETENTION AND MANAGEMENT POLICY
 
[“COVERED INDIVIDUALS” NOTE: SEE BOILERPLATE TEXT DEFINING “COVERED INDIVIDUALS” LISTED SEPARATELY. THIS WILL BE ADDED LATER ONCE THE TEXT IS FINALIZED. BUT WE FELT IT EASIER TO MANAGE COMMENTS ON THE DEFINITION OF “COVERED INDIVIDUALS” ON A STANDALONE BASIS RATHER THAN IN EACH POLICY.] 
 
The Records Retention and Management Policy (the “Records Policy”) of the IETF Administration LLC (the “IETF LLC”) includes the attached Document Retention Matrix. Document retention is the process of managing all types of business documents and records to ensure that they are readily available for as long as they are useful or are required by law to be retained. In general, when documents are no longer useful and are no longer legally required to be retained, they should be destroyed.
 
**Objective of the Records Policy**

The purpose of this Records Policy is to ensure compliance with the IETF LLC’s Privacy Statement and applicable legal and regulatory obligations, while also increasing efficiency and consistency of record storage, minimizing litigation costs, ensuring reliable and accessible records of IETF LLC’s actions and decisions, and ensuring the orderly destruction of relevant documents. The IETF LLC Board shall review this Records Policy periodically to ensure that it continues to meet these objectives. The IETF itself conducts its standards development process openly, and as such many materials are retained -- potentially permanently -- in support of the transparency of IETF processes (e.g. list archives, meeting attendance lists). Individuals seeking removal of information may have rights to do so, and should refer to the IETF Privacy Policy for more information.
 
**1. 	Storage**
Electronic records of relevant IETF LLC documents should be stored in the document management system as may be prescribed by the IETF LLC Board from time to time for the time periods set forth in the Matrix.  
 
Any physical copies of financial, personnel or other confidential records should be stored in secure file cabinets and be locked at the end of each business day.
 
**2. 	Oversight**
The IETF LLC Board shall oversee the implementation and administration of this Records Policy.
 
**3. 	Records Destruction**
At the expiration of the retention period for a particular document, as indicated in the Matrix, a document is eligible for destruction.  The IETF LLC will review documents eligible for destruction and subsequently conduct the records destruction on a periodic basis, on not more than an annual basis. Printed records must be shredded and electronic records must be erased or destroyed and no longer retained in a retrievable form. 
 
**4. 	Document Retention During Litigation and Other Proceedings**
In the event of a lawsuit, service of a subpoena, or initiation of government proceeding, inquiry or investigation that relates to IETF LLC records, the IETF LLC may be required to retain some or all relevant documents relating to the matter, even if the IETF LLC is not yet a party to the lawsuit, target of the investigation, or recipient of a subpoena. If the IETF has records that relate to current or reasonably foreseeable legal proceedings, the IETF LLC shall (with the advice of counsel) evaluate whether it has document retention obligations and the breadth of material that is likely to be encompassed by such obligations. These records will be placed on “Legal Hold” and the original records or copies of the records will be segregated physically or electronically, as applicable for retention as long as necessary. 
 
**5. Notification of IETF LLC Legal Counsel**
As soon as any Covered Individual learns that the IETF LLC is subject to or is reasonably likely to become subject to litigation, a government investigation, or a subpoena, IETF LLC counsel shall be notified immediately.
 
The IETF LLC Executive Director shall notify Covered Individuals as appropriate concerning legal requests and requirements concerning the retention of documents in IETF LLC custody.
